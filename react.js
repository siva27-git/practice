// React is a component based js libraray
//React uses virtual dom

// Normal DOM will load the comeplte webpage when some thig is changes
// Virtual DOM will change only the changes state, and will not load the entire page

// Redux -- state management

// Redux 4 main process

// action -- all actions (example deleteAction)
// reducer -- functioninlay of the action (deleteAction functionality)
// store -- stores the action , so that we can use that anywhere --> store(reducer)
// dispatch -- helps to access the store

// Advantages of React

// JSX -> where we can write html in javascript files

// Virtual Dom --> react uses virtual dom, SO hold a comy of the real dom i the memory, 
// so when some objects changes it will update only the object insted of updating all the objexts

// Components --> everything in react is component. (We can build single page applications easily)

// One way data binding
// High performance

// Single page application --> Having single html page

// use State --> when ever the state is changes re evelualtion will happen

// controlled component --> state is changes during every action of the user in the form
// uncontrolled component --> use refs -- doesnt care about the state changes

//In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component. Whereas in uncontrolled components, form data is handled by the DOM itself.

//Usage of Component State is a must for controlled components. Use of state is completely optional for uncontrolled components, but one must use Refs in it.

//With controlled components, we can validate as the input is being changed but the same is not possible with uncontrolled components.
